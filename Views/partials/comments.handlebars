{{!-- we can use the trusty keyword "this" to refer to the
parent object or array that's available in the context of the partial.

Data that's passed to a template file is technically always part of this,
but when dealing with objects, we can simply access the object properties directly
(e.g., vote_count instead of this.vote_count).

Because arrays don't have named properties like objects do,
we're forced to access the array as this. --}}
