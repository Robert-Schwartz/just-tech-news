/*
Since we set up the routes the way we did, we don't have to worry about importing multiple files for different endpoints. The router instance in routes/index.js collected everything for us and packaged them up for server.js to use.

Also, note we're importing the connection to Sequelize from config/connection.js. Then, at the bottom of the file, we use the sequelize.sync() method to establish the connection to the database. The "sync" part means that this is Sequelize taking the models and connecting them to associated database tables. If it doesn't find a table, it'll create it for you!

The other thing to notice is the use of {force: false} in the .sync() method. This doesn't have to be included, but if it were set to true, it would drop and re-create all of the database tables on startup. This is great for when we make changes to the Sequelize models, as the database would need a way to understand that something has changed. We'll have to do that a few times throughout this project, so it's best to keep the {force: false} there for now.
